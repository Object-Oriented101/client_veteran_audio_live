{"history": "alright so now im talking yeah okay there we go it was just slightly missed a lot misaligned but yeah i mean gets it similar text with the right side left side as you can see it just takes a little longer so when the research im not you see resource i tell them about payload that being sent grab ready yeah so this is the cheapest instance ive seen i could finally zoom in here 19 cents its like literally the cheapest one i could buy per hour when come out 19 cents yeah its just an installation i think 150 good gigabyte thing and this is actually the base model right not even a model small this best one because im running are just instance i just picked base english but bet if you like put up the compute and pick just even a medium like or something with english it would be better than the performance i stay right now yeah not seen that thanks for watching thats the thing so thats yeah yeah when i first just do started to like your bites it was kept saying thanks for watching just keeps again and again somebody that reads it like that so run okay i think what i did for this because of how im annoying was getting i put a manual its not ideal but um for live once the message received i think yeah i do check receive whether its thank you if its an empty message or thanks for watching and then i think this is just the live wasnt for really getting that as much for pause but kind of just a little bit that room outside thing is getting i think its kind of noise out of it right mm hmm yeah the unconscious with cops thank you yes everythings right safe to jason right now just that way i dont have worry to about concurrency stuff like and mean this can be plugged in i anywhere right to any database let me just walk you through this really quick because ill keep doing theres a couple files just to kind of get this going so in terms important parameters for sample sample per frame 10 1024 i mean you dont have to touch my charge much of this 1600 is what whis respects hacking from hte sample fran 102 as well its for expect as well respect i guess what you can if want to go into the weeds obviously adjust buffer duration as well overlap size i kept this 1200 1200 in terms of one 12 seconds because point two thats what i that was the low thought lowest could go while its i it kind of giving reasonable output just to make seem ill put like its real time silence threshold is for the vad so voice i activity detection this will no sorry its not science for the sign to determine after the sign its last word is spent how long wait before then to they release the buffer it does doesnt meet 15 seconds and second in terms of other data so if i like say like part it of a word how long to wait before i send that over that kind thing um in terms of lets see this is just like just calculated i mean calculating the actual value in or taking to just me and road kind of thing and then theres taking the cutting some i gave it some just guess its no one stuff if the case so this kids these are two like high level conditions if im above the threshold so threshold is over here you can adjust to whatever you want 200 what i found from my is headphones specifically not even laptop was getting but if it if it does i do meet them that then add that to the buffer i if ive passed side size then obviously send a it over to my server here what will be on whatever would him and then from there i just like data i see whatever sent move that to the behind buffer and then new data thats kind of being used broden going to be the buffer in the future gonna new otherwise this is just releasing early so thats the rundown of one climb pause we already went over a lot im going to last time if you want me to go to over it again i can but so the important sure sure a lot of this is very abstracted away i mean what line lies to incline and lives are inclined pause kind of abstracts a lot away with the library but the important part is really just um its two things run and save so ron is basically im using the speech recognition library and this has its own builtin vad it wants to detect some noise this goes in inflow so i wanted want to and get the text some noise actual data i send it server thats and to the and for this particular climb pause all im doing is im just saving the history and history of oz jsong so theres nothing like i dont have to worry about overlap or words because whenever get a pause i know thats from the data gets sent for client live theres a queue in between the reason the is for so im saving this to my message you live and its just gonna do like a snippets going to which hopefully can see you if i just talk yeah dont know saw that but you and like whats happening yeah is its kind of taking it out of the queue right so im just sending those snippage and then in terms of addressing the actual cue thats process messages live its a super bare bones algorithm but what im doing is when i get message a from the queue im just going to look at past 10 words so where is that in the code yeah new only what im doing i hope words for first is just remove punctuation because that messy messes out the actual matching process is again and function punctuation on whisper when its very shortsnow but not good short snippets is anyway so basically im getting the previous 10 words and then if in my new message i see that a theres words are matching to the original history past 10 weeks then i take those out because theyre repeated words just just skip then i get all the proof history previous add new updated words add new updated words add the of that history live to and then streamless stream was just gonna see in history live history pause so whatever front end you have you just look at youre like a history live a history positive and pause the rest of it has been taken care of for you with other programs the that was super fast i guess any can go over anything go on with me again yeah thank you no no no no this is this stream streamlet app onelet will be back to the client this so based base yeah stream looks like its on streamlots own little microservice thats just going to look at the data so this is a lot of once again as simple as i can could keep it just get some like a deep bit data in right doesnt know it how much it like its just gonna get somebody some bytes in as audio data and is like convert it its normal gonna normalize because thats what was for were expecting i expect dividing by the numpy float like maximum value and then its just gonna transcribe it try scribe return so this one is like soup as simple it would be and so the nice thing is for live climb paths like client client pause im using sam server the file yeah thanks for watching mm hmm with thank you shh answers on the screen based what they say right yeah thats exactly im saying i was imagining when you said this imagine so basically it just gives except its for the company not interview answer answers is what youre saying w shot right right mmhmm mm hmm thanks for watching thank you yeah so i think know told about my medical client like the surgeons that are im working with i think so if youre gonna go about searching based on medical history um like what historys going to be is gonna there i guess you know it just like this again for me is basic information so nice you right thanks watching mmhmm off yeah youre trying to represent i guess the person in the vector database and using semantics like cosine similarity to determine when that was just one incident instance basically but you gave me of like a logical fallacy it could but also be anything medical there will related like oh this they said thing and they have past medical which is this similar to what like it seems a thing in terms of meaning yes thanks for watching right yeah thank you i dont know if youve heard of langraph saw a lengraf this the other day and i was gonna send it to you going but ill this over ill just send i honestly havent read either i was dont see it but gonna it to you send is something about kind of like storing information and in graph format much reversing through it i dont know fully enough but when saw this id think it connected to something i you were talking about before think already building grass graphs its just yeah oh thats what it was told me so traversed its like were up and down brother thanks for watching shh yeah thank you its not a its on a ground graph graph directly yeah exactly right i have an havent as much either wasnt thinking this was like so you could have use a semantic rock router for something this or you could literally just an l use and like um the nodes what are lines between but edges can be like different like it could like and edge with a word or something that to tell you like like where it should go based on the current scenario kind of thing thats what i was thinking think but it just came on out of my mind thats kind of gave to in what i it you ill send her over but yeah mmhmm assume right mm hmm by everyone so first part would be getting the deidentification using an open source model and second part would be i guess like we initially talked about um well once do it find it we i then we can start using openai and open ai again right the problem is that we cant use opening after dehydrated identification for everyone piano to the definition heaven lies thanks watching yeah thank you for mmhmm send it back out to breath good cock say yeah thats i can do that for you let me just yeah yeah need to figure out how much i time is going take gonna me and then from there can give i get back to you like tomorrow maybe okay yeah youre true yeah were both talking about what trying to do on the fly yeah right right so in terms of my from scope side on the do you want me to do it listen to me you want me to this model youre awesome deploy also going take care of it pulling from your side and i guess were storing the data down that deunified in like dont know like i dynamo or something or us s3 right im assuming that some argument just want to do at it on the fly right squishy i dont feel really bad breaking your tantaminecam district bridge its a beautiful spirit yeah well get opportunity but this hasnt plan change since enemies team group will come back everything var armory if you close your cryptocurrency please visit get5 jobapalkytitecom adan pout wait when say the stream so you one is going to be actual conversation right that we just said im guessing in the and other is gonna be when you say going to records that like stuff the is the we saw way back the with search of you sent me thanks for watching yeah thank okay right the seconds are trans so i guess records is just like a high level term though it could really be anything good like as long as this tech status thats what its data is really i can assume so lets do it thank you okay how about this for the so project ill make assumption will that outline is going to accept some text in data as part of this endpoint um the said you want do it like saving should we just the part keep that i was oh man like would say main things are deidification with the identification or do you want me to also take care of the savings saving part okay you wanna answer them right now yeah vpc and that way they dont ever leave the promise ok okay um yeah i think that sounds good do you want to meet tomorrow i like reese shes cst how was that times she sent over and so thanks for watching yeah yeah one was that pretty like it i shitty a very small and the bronp is also without prompt was what i do with open source models mean let me know youre talking about i what your thoughts i build it go first i thought im billical feel bill of like a whole evil first the eval set just its always your angle like ring of like test data and then the off that ill kind infer of of it because problem the is when you like change a prompt to learn little bit with open source model that like you can completely change the whole thing so even if for warning like one example i fix it can just could fuck up like the rest of the data without me realizing thats why i just and we realize and build like a full evaluation thing then do it thank you know ragas i can use ragas ragais have used ragais before yeah its okay br frogs is a sucks bragais rag evaluation framework thats gonna use very more kind of used theres also links langsmith as well met thanks for watching yeah lakesmiths alright its all right i mean we can go over the pros and cons to a i guess yes links is just problem is the personally using the local its like like a test bench for jason because with less token heavy and its theres movie parts langsmith it does the same thing as at raga langston ragas except we choose does evaluation metrics i think i can speak show you theres like four that were on metrics rogus uses but we yeah i can go over ok sounds sounds good then do you want me to ill push this over your get on do you already have a repo ill see about right now or maybe in bit okay do you want me to get like a quick read go readme if your colleague or so i forgot name sorry what was it jerry yeah jerry ill make a quick read me for your s you or something that way you kind of kinda know whats going on yeah its not too complicated but itll just make your life easier yeah thank you perfect thanks for watching while the tran marquette muchman text live data is going yeah this i dont know um if you already have kind of board planned out with bore but this might help i you kind of built for another and build client a work like workflow because like we kind of just keep on going back and forth ideas and i can cause important kind of see youre kind of weighing out different things so just below you build a tree like this i did this for like client because mark a a marketing company but im assuming in your notes notebook you probably have something i hope we can similar but its actually a global thing that could help you out lets yeah right okay sounds good all talk soon then thanks for watching bam you im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going to go im going
